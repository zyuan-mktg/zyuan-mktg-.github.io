Hi, I'm Zhen Yuan, a pre-doc [research professional](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/research-staff/join-our-team) at the Booth School of Business.


I study consumer behaviors and public health using industrial organization and quantitative marketing tools. You can find additional information about my work [here](/research/).


In my free time, I enjoy both watching and playing various sports, and spending time with pets.
